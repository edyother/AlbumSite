		  <p class="blog_post">2022/03/6: I started recording this one today. It's just an old tune that I like, and is fun to play.<br>Flute - Ed Yother</p>


	<!-- Loved Her Set-->

              preload="auto"> </audio></p>
		  <p class="blog_post">2022/03/6: Last night I started recording flute for this set. And as I have never actually learned to play any of these of flute before, that's going to take some work.<br>2022/02/28: Tonight I started recording a set of jigs I wrote.<br>Octave Mandolin - Ed Yother</p>

	<!-- Oak Cliff Road 3-->
		  <p style="margin-left: 0px"><h5><strong>The Oak Cliff Road / O'Dowd's Pitch / Kitty on the Rail - 2022/02/28<audio src="audio/Oak Cliff Road 3.mp3"

		  <p class="blog_post">2022/02/28: I've decided to include the third tune in the set. I've also made a change to that tune, and re-recorded the set in preparation for another friend to come record fiddle on it. 2022/02/21: A set of three reels that I wrote. The same as the recording below, except including a reel that I wrote around the same time, but had kind of forgotten about. I'm still not sure if I want to include this third one or not. I'm a little more self conscious about it.<br>Tenor Banjo - Ed Yother</p>
		  
	<!-- Dirty Old Town -->

              preload="auto"> </audio></p>
		<p class="blog_post">2022/02/24: Tonight I re-recorded this one. This time without my 3D printer running in the background, so it's sounding much better. There's still little things I need to fix, but other than that I was intending to keep the arrangement pretty simple, so I don't think I'll be adding any other instruments or players to it.<br>2022/02/15:This is another one that I've been wanting to get my interpretation of recorded for some time. I've always felt connected to this song as it very much reminds me of where I grew up, which was an old factory town at the confluence of two rivers that hadn't had any factories since my grandfather retired. A whole lot of my adolescence was spent walking around at night on railroad tracks and levees. I feel like there have been enough recordings of this one with a sort of tough guy from a tough town bravado. I feel like it deserves at least one wistful, contemplative treatment.<br>This is another one that's sounding a little rough right now. I had to eq the hell out of it to cover up some background noise, but I really wanted to get this sketch of a recording down while in the mood for it. <br>Guitar - Ed Yother<br>Vocals - Ed Yother</p>

		<p class="blog_post">2022/02/14:I just recorded this tonight. I feel like it's still in kind of a rough state. But I don't hate it.

		  <p class="blog_post">2022/02/12: I just had an idea for a mandolin part and quickly recorded it. I still need to redo it without the mistakes. I also still need to properly record the vocals.

			<p class="blog_post">2022/02/11: If I do anything else to this one it will be bringing in a friend to play guitar or fiddle, or something. <br>
			2022/02/14: I lied. I think I'm going to re-record the OM part. I have lighter that strings on it that I usually use, and I don't think I like them.<br>Octave Mandolin - Ed Yother<br>Flute - Ed Yother</p>
